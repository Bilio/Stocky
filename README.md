- Applied Graphing feature of percent changes
- Trying to implement a net


# Monday Feb 27

# Monday March 6
- Collecting data
- Running combination of programs
  - I am able to collect data with stocky.py and now adding that data to stockyNN.py // FIXED
  - need to continue working with tensorflow to be able to predict
  - create make file / FIXED

- A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts : Burton Malkiel
- Working on new route and have NEW STOCKY.PY
- Analyzing S&P500
- Note: we can access data behind but not forward
- We use a recurrent nureal net
- long short term memory -> elimnates
- we have 50 outputs because of the recurrent
- mean square error (define)
- 1.  Recurrent nets can model sequential data because the hidden state is affected by the input and the previous hidden state
- 2. A solution to the vanishing gradient probelem is to use LSTM cells to remember long-term dependencies
- 3. We can use LSTM networks to make predictions for time series data easily using Keras and tensorflow

# Sunday March 20
- Running Prediction on 2016 from data from CMG start
- create compilation
- fix data
